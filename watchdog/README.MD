In order to prepare the environment you will need to:

**Assuming that you already installed pip and python**

1. cd myproject
2. python3 -m venv venv

- . venv/bin/activate -> mac
- venv\Scripts\activate -> windows

3. pip install Flask
4. pip install face-recognition
5. flask run -> you need to set the app first using command: export FLASK_APP=project.py && set FLASK_APP=project.py
